# ☺ Welcome to my MAGD-150 Assignments ☺

These are a few of the works I have made while in my Media Arts and Game Development class.

### ▸[_Buildings_](https://github.com/WesMcW/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/Buildings/Buildings.pde).
      This is the first project I created, and it is a night skyline of a city using only a grayscale color scheme.

### ▸[_Tevevision_](https://github.com/WesMcW/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/TV/Attempt/Attempt.pde).
      This project has a tevevison set with two buttons attached. Once one button is pressed the other lights up 
      and prints out to the consol which one the user has pressed.
      
### ▸[_Weather_](https://github.com/WesMcW/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/Weather/Weather.pde).
      In this project it depicts the inside of a snowglobe, with a snowman standing in the center atop of a hill.
      With lots of little snowflakes whirling around him.

### ▸[_Type_](https://github.com/WesMcW/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/Type/Type.pde).
      This is my project of a movie poster. When started up the program askes for the users name, once entered the
      screen then changes to show a movie poster withe the leading role of the name entered.

### ▸[_Cat_](https://github.com/WesMcW/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/Cat/Cat.pde).
      In this project I had taken a video of my cat and imported the sound of lion and an image of grass.
      I then put them all together to make it look like my cat had a mighty roar while on the the prowl hidden
      in the grass
