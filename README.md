# ☺ Welcome to my MAGD-150 Assignmnts ☺

These are a few of the works I have made while in my Media Arts and Game Development class.

### •[_Buildings_](https://github.com/WesMcW/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/Buildings/Buildings.pde).
      This is the first project I created, and it is a night skyline of a city using only a grayscale color scheme.

### •[_Tevevision_](https://github.com/WesMcW/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/TV/Attempt/Attempt.pde)
      This project has a tevevison set with two buttons attached. And once one button is pressed the other lights up and prints out to the consol which one the user has pressed.
