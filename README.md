# ☺ Welcome to my MAGD-150 Assignments ☺

These are a few of the works I have made while in my Media Arts and Game Development class.

### •[_Buildings_](https://github.com/WesMcW/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/Buildings/Buildings.pde).
      This is the first project I created, and it is a night skyline of a city using only a grayscale color scheme.

### •[_Tevevision_](https://github.com/WesMcW/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/TV/Attempt/Attempt.pde).
      This project has a tevevison set with two buttons attached. Once one button is pressed the other lights up 
      and prints out to the consol which one the user has pressed.
      
### •[_Weather_](https://github.com/WesMcW/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/Weather/Weather.pde).
      In this project it depicts the inside of a snowglobe, with a snowman standing in the center atop of a hill.
      With lots of little snowflakes whirling around him.
